# 🚀 PWA Setup Guide for IT Panel

Your IT Panel has been successfully configured as a Progressive Web App! Follow these steps to complete the setup and deploy.

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install next-pwa
```

This installs the `next-pwa` package that enables PWA functionality in your Next.js app.

---

## 🎨 Step 2: Generate PWA Icons

You need to create app icons in various sizes. Choose one of these methods:

### Option A: Automatic Generation (Recommended)

1. Place your logo as `public/logo-source.png` (512x512 or larger recommended)
2. Install sharp:
   ```bash
   npm install sharp
   ```
3. Run the generator:
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-icons.js
   ```

### Option B: Online Generator (Easiest)

1. Visit: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo (512x512 recommended)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Extract all icons to `public/icons/` folder

### Option C: Manual Creation

Use an image editor to create these sizes:
- 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512 pixels
- Maskable icons: 192x192 and 512x512 (with 10% padding)

**Required files in `public/icons/`:**
- `icon-72x72.png`
- `icon-96x96.png`
- `icon-128x128.png`
- `icon-144x144.png`
- `icon-152x152.png`
- `icon-192x192.png`
- `icon-384x384.png`
- `icon-512x512.png`
- `icon-maskable-192x192.png`
- `icon-maskable-512x512.png`

---

## 🏗️ Step 3: Build and Test Locally

### Build the App
```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Generate your Next.js production build
- Automatically create service worker files (`sw.js`, `workbox-*.js`)
- Enable PWA features

### Start Production Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Test PWA Features

1. Open Chrome/Edge browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Open DevTools (F12) → Application tab
4. Check:
   - ✅ Manifest: Should show your app details
   - ✅ Service Worker: Should be registered and running
   - ✅ Storage: Check caches are being created

### Test Installation

1. In Chrome address bar, look for the **install icon** (⊕)
2. Click it to install the app
3. App should open in standalone window
4. Check if icon appears on desktop/start menu

### Test Offline Mode

1. Open the app
2. Visit different pages (dashboard, assignments, etc.)
3. Open DevTools → Network tab
4. Set throttling to "Offline"
5. Refresh or navigate - cached pages should still work!

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

### Deploy Command
```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or push to GitHub and Vercel will auto-deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Add PWA support"
git push
```

### After Deployment

1. Visit your deployed URL in Chrome on Android
2. You should see "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Install the app
4. Test all features
