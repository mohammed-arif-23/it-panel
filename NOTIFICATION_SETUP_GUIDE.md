# üîî Push Notification Setup Guide

## Problem Identified
Push notifications were being sent from backend (200 OK) but not displaying on client side because:
1. Service Worker didn't have push event handlers
2. VAPID keys were set but SW wasn't listening for push events

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Push Notification Service Workers
- **`public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`** - Main push handler
- **`public/sw-custom.js`** - Alternative push handler
- **`public/push-sw.js`** - Dedicated push SW

### 2. Updated Service Worker Registration
- Modified `app/layout.tsx` to register SW with push support
- Added message listeners for push events

### 3. Added Test Utilities
- **`lib/testNotification.ts`** - Browser console test functions

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Check Service Worker Registration
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then(reg => {
  console.log('SW Active:', reg.active);
  console.log('Push Manager:', reg.pushManager);
});
```

### Step 2: Check Push Subscription
Run in console:
```javascript
testPushSubscription()
```
Should show your current subscription endpoint.

### Step 3: Test Browser Notification
Run in console:
```javascript
testNotification()
```
Should show a test notification immediately.

### Step 4: Test Service Worker Notification
Run in console:
```javascript
testSWNotification()
```
Should show notification via SW.

### Step 5: Send Real Push from Admin
1. Go to admin panel
2. Send notification with target='all'
3. Check browser console for push event logs
4. Notification should appear

## üîç Debugging

If notifications still don't show:

1. **Check Notification Permission**
```javascript
console.log('Permission:', Notification.permission);
```

2. **Check VAPID Keys**
```javascript
console.log('Public Key:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY);
```

3. **Check Push Subscription**
```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
  reg.pushManager.getSubscription().then(sub => {
    console.log('Subscription:', sub ? sub.endpoint : 'None');
  });
});
```

4. **Check Service Worker Console**
- Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers
- Click "inspect" on active SW
- Check console for push event logs

## üåê Browser Console Logs to Look For

**Success:**
```
[Push SW] Push received: PushEvent
[Push SW] Payload: {title: "Test", body: "Testing Notification"}
[Push SW] Notification shown successfully
```

**Permission Granted:**
```
‚úÖ Push subscription active
```

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: "No push subscription found"
**Fix:** User needs to grant notification permission first
```javascript
// Request permission
Notification.requestPermission().then(result => {
  console.log('Permission:', result);
});
```

### Issue 2: Push event not firing
**Fix:** Ensure VAPID keys match between client and server
- Check `.env` has both public and private keys
- Restart dev server after changing env vars

### Issue 3: Notifications show but click doesn't work
**Fix:** Check notificationclick handler in SW
- Should focus/navigate to correct URL

## üì± Production Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] VAPID keys set in production env vars
- [ ] Service worker accessible at `/sw.js`
- [ ] Push handler scripts in `public/` folder
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (required for push)
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## üîê Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:your@email.com
```
