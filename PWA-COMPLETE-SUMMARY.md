## 🚨 YOU NEED TO DO (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Install the Package ⚡
```bash
npm install next-pwa
```

### Step 2: Generate Icons 🎨
Choose ONE option:

**Option A - Online (Easiest, 5 minutes):**
1. Go to: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo (512x512px or larger)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Extract ALL icons to `public/icons/` folder

**Option B - Automatic Script:**
```bash
# 1. Add your logo as public/logo-source.png (512x512 or larger)
# 2. Install sharp and run generator
npm install sharp
node scripts/generate-icons.js
```

**Option C - Manual (Photoshop/GIMP):**
- Create icons in these sizes: 72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512
- Also create maskable icons: 192, 512 (with 10% padding)
- Save all to `public/icons/` folder

### Step 3: Build & Test 🧪
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and look for the install icon (⊕) in Chrome's address bar!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Install icon not showing"

- Visit site at least once
- Ensure icons exist in `public/icons/`
- Check DevTools → Application → Manifest

### "Service Worker not registering"
- Must build first: `npm run build`
- Must run production: `npm start` (not `npm run dev`)
- Check browser console for errors

### "Offline mode not working"
- Visit pages first to cache them
- Check DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
- Service worker needs time to cache on first visit

### "Icons not showing in app"
- Ensure all icon files exist in `public/icons/`
- Check manifest.json paths
- Clear cache and reinstall
